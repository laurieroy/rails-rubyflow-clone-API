# API 
This is a codealong to see how to properly make a TDD API using rails, RSpec and factoryBot. This was built as a [code along](https://www.udemy.com/course/ruby-on-rails-api-the-complete-guide) with Sebastian Wilgosz, making an API similar to RubyFlow.

GEMS Used
- rspec-rails
- factory_bot_rails
- jsonapi-serializer
- jsom-pagination, which is wrapper for pagy
- pagy 
- jsonapi_errors_handler, which was developed by the instructor. However it hasn't been upgraded to work w/6.1, so to follow along with the course, I'll build in 6.0 and come back to this at some point.
